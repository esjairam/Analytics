Build and interact with your intelligent chatbot with NLP!

Do you want your machine to analyze, understand, and generate human speech? Do you want to build chatbots? NLP is the next step in bridging 
many concerns that users, businesses, and developers experience with customer service.

Chatbots are making it easier and replacing humans everywhere in social media, websites, stores, and even business-to-business conversations. 
With a less talk and more action approach, this course will lead you through various implementations of NLP techniques by implementing 
end-to-end deep learning models and creating an intelligent chatbot on our own.

Get your hands on this course to learn the most fascinating technology in the field of AI and leverage the power of TensorFlow right away!

This hands-on course covers all the important aspects of Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning models with TensorFlow. Throughout 
the course, you’ll build an intelligent chatbot with step-by-step instructions to implement them following the intuition topics.
